</h2>
<p>In the field of artificial intelligence, especially in natural language processing and computer vision, large neural network models have become a cornerstone. <strong>However, the initialization and learning rates of these models are often determined through heuristic methods, varying significantly between different studies and model sizes.</strong> <em>This inconsistency can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly when scaling up models, resulting in inefficient training processes and less effective models.</em> As models grow larger, the tuning process becomes increasingly costly and time-consuming.</p>
<p>The concept of <strong>µ-Parameterization (µP)</strong> provides a potential solution to this problem. µP offers scaling rules for model initialization and learning rates, enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer from small models to larger ones. This technique promises stable training and optimal hyperparameters at scale with minimal cost. Despite its potential, µP has not been widely adopted due to its complexity and the need for further empirical validation.</p>

<p><strong>µ-Parameterization (µP)</strong> is a set of rules for initializing neural networks and setting learning rates that allows for the seamless transfer of hyperparameters from small proxy models to larger target models. This approach is grounded in a Gaussian Process interpretation of deep neural networks, where the width of the network (number of neurons per layer) is a critical factor.</p>
<p>The core idea is to scale the initialization and learning rates based on the width of the network. The general formulation of µP when training with the Adam optimizer and using an i.i.d. Gaussian initialization is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialization Variance</strong>: Parameters are initialized with a variance that scales inversely with the width of the layer. For example, if the width of a layer is <em><strong>M</strong></em>, then the initialization variance for weight matrices  <em><strong>W<sub>AQ</sub>, W<sub>AK</sub>, W<sub>AV</sub></strong></em> is

<script defer src="/katex/katex.min.js"></script>
<script defer src="/katex/auto-render.min.js" onload="renderMathInElement(document.body);"></script><span>
  \(\frac{1}{M}\)
</span>
.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Rate</strong>: The learning rate for each parameter is scaled based on the width of the network. For instance, the learning rate for the same weight matrices <em><strong>W<sub>AQ</sub>, W<sub>AK</sub>, W<sub>AV</sub></strong></em> is <span>
  \(\frac{αP}{M}\)
</span>
, where <em><strong>α</strong></em> is the base learning rate and <em><strong>P</strong></em> is a fixed proxy model width.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These scaling rules ensure that the behavior of small and large models remains consistent, facilitating the transfer of optimal hyperparameters across different model sizes.</p>
<h3 id="practical-implementation">
  Practical Implementation
  <a class="anchor" href="#practical-implementation">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In practical terms, µP involves specific scaling rules for various components of a transformer model, which is a popular architecture in NLP and computer vision. For example, the initialization variance for the weight matrices in the attention mechanism and MLP blocks is set according to the width of the model. Similarly, the learning rate is adjusted to maintain consistent training dynamics across different scales.</p>
<p>Below is an example of µP scaling rules for transformers:</p>

<p>One of the significant advantages of µ-Parameterization is the concept of µ-Transfer. This method allows hyperparameters, such as learning rates, found optimal in small models to be transferred directly to larger models without the need for extensive re-tuning. This process is particularly beneficial for scaling models efficiently and maintaining consistent performance across different model sizes.</p>
<h3 id="steps-in-µ-transfer">
  Steps in µ-Transfer
  <a class="anchor" href="#steps-in-%c2%b5-transfer">#</a>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Training a Small Proxy Model</strong>: Begin by training a small proxy model, which is easier and less expensive to experiment with. Perform hyperparameter tuning on this model to find the optimal learning rate and other hyperparameters. For instance, let&rsquo;s denote the optimal learning rate found for this small model as α.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scaling the Hyperparameters</strong>: Use the scaling rules provided by µP to adapt the hyperparameters for a larger model. The key scaling rule here is that the learning rate should be adjusted based on the ratio of the widths of the large model to the small model. For example, if the small model has a width 128 and the large model has a width 2048, the scaled learning rate for the large model would be <span>
  \(\frac{α2048}{128}\)
</span>
.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applying the Scaled Hyperparameters</strong>: Implement these scaled hyperparameters in the larger model. This involves adjusting the initialization variance and learning rates according to the µP rules to ensure that the training dynamics remain stable and consistent.</p>

</h3>
<p>The objective of these experiments is to examine how various methods that can enhance performance affect the actual transfer of learning rates from smaller width models to larger models with µP and their impact on performance in reality. While the existing µP aimed at transferring initialization and learning rates, this experiment focused on the learning rate, an important hyperparameter in large transformer models. <br/>
The experiments were implemented using Jax/Flax on TPU V3, and the optimal learning rate was determined by measuring the validation loss. Models with widths of <span>
  \(M\)
</span>
 = {128, 512, 2048} have parameters ranging from 4.7M to 1.2B, with the depth fixed at L = 24. The reason for focusing solely on width and not depth is that in the case of depthwise µP, only one linear layer is used per residual block, whereas transformers use at least two layers. So, in this experiment, width is the main change to control the # of parameters.<br/></p>

The baseline represents the experimental results used as a reference for performance improvement or degradation across various experimental settings. In the baseline using µP, it is confirmed that the optimal learning rate for the smallest model is also the optimal learning rate for larger models that are 4x wider (16x larger).<br/>
The experimental results can be categorized into three main groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transfer O, Performance Improvement O</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Cases where both learning rate transfer and performance improvement is observed.</li>

<p>Adding a bias vector to the linear layer does not guarantee an improvement in model performance. In fact, experimental results showed that the performance was similar to that of the baseline and learning rate transfer across the model size and width under µP.</p>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467">RMSNorm</a> is a normalization method that uses the root mean square instead of the mean and standard deviation.
<br/><span>

 <br/>
To re-scale the standardized summed inputs, a trainable gain <span>
  \(g_i\)
</span>
 and bias <span>
  \(b_i\)
</span>
 were used. The gain can be implemented in two forms: a vector gain and a scalar multiplier. Similar to projection bias, the use of a trainable gain does not guarantee performance improvement.<br/>
The results showed that transfer does not occur in any case, vector gain and scalar multiplier, and performance degradation was observed in the models with the largest width.<br/>
On the other hand, using normalized embedding with RMSNorm without a trainable gain did not improve performance, but it was observed that the learning rate transfer was successful.</p>

For query projection, µP initialization typically uses a Gaussian distribution with variance <span>
  \(\Theta(1/M)\)

Adjusting the learning rate over iterations is an open problem with no definitive solution, with methods like power and exponential scheduling. This experiment use <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR.html">cosine scheduling</a>, which is the method that periodically decreases and increases the learning rate to prevent convergence to local minima. This approach can help the model escape suboptimal points and potentially find better solutions.The baseline used a linear schedule, but switching to cosine scheduling did not negatively impact transfer. However, a slight performance degradation was observed with cosine scheduling compared to the baseline.</p>

When optimizing hyperparameters with Adam, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101">decoupled weight decay</a> method separates the weight decay from the optimization step, allowing independent exploration of the learning rate and weight decay factor. Experimental results using decoupled weight decay showed that optimal learning rate transfer was not achieved. A large <span>
  \(\lambda\)
</span>
 value was suggested as a potential cause for this issue. In this experiment, <span>
  \(\lambda = 0.1\)
</span>
 was used. The smaller difference in optimal learning rates between small and large models, compared to other transfer failures, suggested that reducing <span>
  \(\lambda\)
</span>
 may help resolve the transfer problem.</p>

To enhance the performance of transformers, multiplicative nonlinearity activation functions such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202">SwiGLU</a> and Squared ReLU can be utilized. SwiGLU is an activation function created by combining the Swish activation function with the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) and is considered to get better performance compared to traditional activation methods. . The formulas for each are as follows: <br/><br/>
<span>
  \(Swish(x) = x\sigma (\beta x)\)
</span>
 (<span>
  \(\sigma\)
</span>
 : sigmoid function, <span>
  \(\beta\)

  \(SwiGLU(x,W,V,b,c, \beta) = Swish_\beta(xW&#43;b)\otimes(xV&#43;c)\)
</span>
<br/><br/></p>
<p>Similarly, Squared ReLU, which is obtained by squaring the ReLU activation function, is known to help improve performance. Experimental results showed that they allow µ-transfer of the learning rate across model sizes and unlike the RMSNorm gain, there was a performance improvement from the perspective of multiplicative interaction.</p>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466">Yang et al. (2021)</a> stateed that µP models perform better than SP models, and our various experiments with SP settings confirmed that some of the µP settings offer advantages in terms of transfer and model performance.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>attention scale<br/>
Usual attention scaling is <span>
  \(\tau^{-1} = 1/\sqrt{D}\)
</span>
, while µP proposes <span>
  \(\tau^{-1} = \Theta(1/D)\)
</span>
, and baseline experiment was implemented using a simple <span>
  \((1/D\)
</span>
) scaling. In this experiment, attention scaling was <span>
  \(1/\sqrt{D}\)
</span>
 to check the SP setting. For the <span>
  \(M = 128\)
</span>
 model, the optimal learning rate was <span>
  \(2^{-8}\)
</span>
, but for larger models, the optimal learning rate was changed to <span>
  \(2^{-6}\)
</span>
. This means that transfer did not occur, and performance slightly deteriorated compared to the original baseline.</li>
<li>unembedding initialization<br/>
The initialization of µP&rsquo;s unembedding matrix follows a Gaussian distribution with a variance of <span>
  \(\Theta(1/M^2)\)
</span>
, while standard parametrization (SP) uses <span>
  \(1/M\)
</span>
. Experiments using the original SP method with <span>

</span>
 showed that transfer was maintained and there was a slight improvement in performance for larger models. <br/></li>

To compare the result of the SP and µP,  this experiment was implemented using SP and compared the result with baseline's. The differences between the baseline and SP included using trainable biases in linear layers, trainable gains in RMSNorm layers, attention scale <span>
  \(1/\sqrt{D}\)
</span>
, and unembedding initialization variance <span>
  \(1/M\)
</span>
. All other hyperparameters remained the same. The combined results for SP transformers showed that transfer does not occur, and the optimal loss is lower in performance compared to the baseline.

By adjusting the batch size while keeping the number of training tokens constant, it is possible to reduce training time or determine the minimum batch size required for operation.

The paper experimentally confirmed that when Standard Parameterization was applied to MLP and Transformer models, the hyperparameter stability was low. However, using µ Parameterization enabled stable transfer by using width-128 network and width-8192 network. <br/>
The experiement sweeped the width and depth by changing only one of the hyperparameters—learning rate, output weight multiplier, initialization standard deviation, and learning rate schedule to check if they transfer across scale dimensions. Optimal hyperparameters transfered well across scale dimensions when the minimum width, depth, batch size, sequence length, and training steps were met. However, unlike the changes in width where hyperparameter transfer occured to wider models, the transfer to deeper models was less effective. The reason is same as the main paper's fixed depth and the experiments in this paper also adjusted the scale by fixing the depth and only varying the width.<br/>
In this paper, experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency and performance of µ-Transfer using various models: from a 10M to 40M Transformer on IWSLT14 De-En, from a 15M to 211M Transformer on WMT14 En-De, from a 13M to 110M BERT and to 350M BERT-large. The largest model tested was the GPT-3, where the width is shrunk from 4096 to 256, resulting in a scale difference from 40M to 6.7B, representing a 168x scale difference. The total tuning cost was only 7% of total pretraining cost and the hyperparameter was stable across the scale.<br/><br/>
<p>Contribution of the main paper : The performance of µ-Transfer, which has been proven effective with a scale difference of up to 168x, was experimentally confirmed to be reliable even with a scale difference of up to 5000x. The paper also conducted experiments not only comparing SP (Standard Parameterization) and µP (µ Parameterization) overall but also by changing specific elements such as attention scale.</p>

  Conclusion
  <a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The paper demonstrates that the transfer properties observed with µ-Parameterization (µP) can be maintained across most scenarios. µP outperforms standard parameterization (SP) and confirms the efficacy of part-by-part transfer for elements like attention scale and unembedding initialization, validating µP&rsquo;s superiority. Additionally, it shows that transfer is feasible for models ranging from 2M to 10B parameters (5000x), suggesting applicability to larger models.<br/>
However, some issues are identified where optimal learning rate transfer does not occur, or there is a performance decline in large models. For instance, trainable RMSNorm gain and decoupled weight decay do not function properly for learning rate transfer. Although transfer is observed with projection biases and cosine scheduling, there is no performance improvement or even a decline.<br/>
The impressive performance of µ-Transfer demonstrated in this paper is expected to be highly beneficial in the current AI landscape, where model sizes are continually increasing. However, tuning hyperparameters for large models is not always feasible, indicating a need for further research.
<br/><br/></p>
<p>The suggested further research areas are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed explanation and analysis of each experiment, investigating the causes of transfer failures and potential solutions through the expansion of each experiment (e.g., experiments on specific SP elements, experiments with various batch sizes).</li>
<li>Scaling adjustment through depth rather than width and exploring its transferability.</li>
<li>Transferability of other hyperparameters.
<br/><br/></li>

<p>The significance of this paper lies in summarizing the impact of various methods on performance and transfer under µ through ablation experiments. However, it is limited by focusing on many ablations without additional experiments for detailed results, leading to a lack of comprehensive analysis. For instance, where transfer fails, minor differences in optimal learning rates between small and large models suggest potential for improvement, but no further experiments were conducted. Structural issues in transformers make scaling adjustments through depth challenging, and research on architectures that allow adjustments through both depth and width could increase flexibility. Additionally, expanding the scope of transfer to include other hyperparameters like the output weight multiplier, initialization standard deviation, and learning rate schedule is necessary.<br/></p>
<p>We also believe µ-Parameterization offers a promising solution to one of the significant bottlenecks in training large neural networks. Its potential to standardize and simplify the hyperparameter tuning process is a substantial step forward. However, the complexity of its implementation and the need for more empirical validation remain hurdles to its widespread adoption.</p>
<p>To fully realize the benefits of µP, the following future research directions are proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Empirical Validation</strong>: Conduct large-scale studies across various types of neural networks and applications to validate µP’s effectiveness and identify any limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Development</strong>: Create user-friendly tools and libraries that automate the µP scaling process, making it more accessible to practitioners.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Approaches</strong>: Explore combining µP with other optimization methods like LAMB to further enhance training efficiency and performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these future research directions, the full potential of µ-Parameterization can be unlocked, paving the way for more efficient and effective neural network training methodologies.</p>
