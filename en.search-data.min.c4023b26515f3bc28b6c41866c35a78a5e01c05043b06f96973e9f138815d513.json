Students (will) upload a blog post reviewing the paper.\nGuideline for Students # First, make the folder named Paper Number_Paper Title_Member1_Member2 (e.g. 0_TACO_HagyeongLee). You can use initials of paper title. If there is no optimal initials, then you can skip the paper name (e.g. 0_HagyeongLee). Second, you put the markdown file and assests(e.g. figures) in the folder. Finally, if you verify that the markdown file is rendering successfully.

By doing so, they avoid decoding based on text-guided generative models\u0026mdash;known for high generative diversity\u0026mdash;and effectively utilize the semantic information of text at a global level.\nExample : Using KaTeX for math equation # KaTeX shortcode let you render math typesetting in markdown document.
